# 0. Introduce StaFi's Liquid Staking Modularity Store

StaFi is building a comprehensive Liquid Staking Modularity Store to better serve the evolving needs of liquid staking developers and protocols. While we’ve already developed a foundation of key modules, including tools like the Validator Selection AI Agent, Solana Blinks, and more (see Appendix for details), the next logical step is to create an open platform that invites developers to contribute and expand this ecosystem.

With this proposal, we aim to open up StaFi's modular capabilities, encouraging al developers to co-create and innovate within LSaaS (Liquid Staking as a Service) and its Modularity. This open modular stack will allow developers to craft tailored solutions that enhance the staking experience for users and drive the future of liquid staking protocols.

Together, we can build a more robust and adaptable ecosystem that fosters collaboration, growth, and innovation in liquid staking.

# 1. StaFi Modularity and its Functions

**StaFi Modularity** is an open marketplace within the StaFi protocol ecosystem, designed specifically for LST (Liquid Staking Token) and LRT (Liquid Reward Token) protocols. This platform allows developers to create, upload, and distribute various modules that can be seamlessly integrated into different LST/LRT protocols. The goal is to offer end-users a richer, more personalized staking experience while promoting the StaFi LSaaS (Liquid Staking as a Service) brand—a development system tailored for LST and LRT.

## **Module Functions**:

- **Enhanced Functionality**: Modules can introduce additional features to protocols, such as AI based validator selection strategy, automation processes, and data analytics, making LST/LRT protocols more flexible and efficient.
- **Improved User Experience**: By integrating different modules, protocols can offer higher-quality services and customized staking experiences, such as personalized yield optimization and real-time reward systems.
- **Ecosystem Expansion**: The modular design enables protocols to easily incorporate new features, driving innovation and diversity through the StaFi ecosystem.

# 2. Developer Benefits from the StaFi Modularity App Store

**Exposure and Visibility**: By listing modules on the StaFi Modularity app store, developers gain exposure to a broad audience within the StaFi ecosystem. This increases the likelihood of module adoption by various LST/LRT protocols, enhancing their reach and impact.

**Monetization Opportunities**: Developers can monetize their modules directly by setting their own prices, with all earnings going directly to them. This offers a clear and straightforward revenue stream, making it an attractive opportunity for developers to capitalize on their work.

**Promotion and Marketing Support**: Outstanding modules receive additional promotion from the StaFi marketing members. This includes featuring on the official website and in other marketing channels, further boosting the module's visibility and adoption.

**Innovation and Collaboration**: The open marketplace fosters innovation by allowing developers to experiment with new ideas and collaborate with others in the ecosystem. This collaborative environment encourages the creation of cutting-edge solutions that can benefit the entire StaFi community.

# 3. Module Integration Rules, Requirements, and Process

## **Module Integration Rules and Requirements**:

1. **Technical Standards**: Modules must adhere to StaFi platform’s technical specifications, including interface definitions, data formats, and performance requirements. Developers should follow the provided technical guidelines to ensure compatibility.
2. **Security**: Although formal code audits are highly recommended, they are not mandatory. Developers should ensure their modules are secure and free of vulnerabilities, with complete documentation provided.
3. **Compliance**: Modules must not contain any content that violates legal regulations or StaFi platform terms of use, including illegal content, malicious code, or infringing materials.
4. **User Experience**: Modules should follow best practices for user experience, ensuring ease of use and intuitive interaction for end-users.

**Basic Module Integration Process**:

1. **Developer Submission**: Developers create a pull request (PR) on GitHub, which should primarily include frontend code and corresponding LSaaS modularity documentation, adhering to the provided standards.
2. **StaFi DAO Review**: The StaFi DAO reviews the submitted PR, focusing on code quality, security, and alignment with platform standards.
3. **Module Listing**: Once the module passes the review, it is listed on the StaFi Modularity app store, making it available for integration by LST/LRT protocols.

# 4. Review Process and Profit Sharing Mechanism

## **Review Process**:

1. **StaFi Initial Review**: Modules undergo an initial review for security, performance, and compliance. The process is designed to be straightforward to encourage quick module deployment.
2. **Feedback and Revisions**: If a module does not meet the requirements, developers will receive feedback and can revise the module for resubmission.
3. **Highlighting Outstanding Modules**: Exceptional modules will be featured on the StaFi official website, with a possible dedicated introduction page. The StaFi marketing team will also support the promotion of these modules, increasing visibility and adoption.

## **Potential Profit Sharing Mechanisms:**

Since the StaFi Modularity Store is newly established and represents the industry's first initiative of its kind, the current profit-sharing system is designed primarily for the initialization phase. As the platform evolves, the system’s details and approaches are expected to change over time. The early-stage model serves as a flexible foundation, with the potential for future enhancements based on developer feedback and market needs.

In the future, we foresee several potential profit-sharing models that could be introduced:

1. **Tiered Pricing Models**: A system where different pricing tiers could be applied depending on the module’s complexity, popularity, or feature set. This could give developers more tailored monetization strategies based on the type of product they offer.
2. **Revenue Sharing**: Exploring a revenue-sharing system in which StaFi and developers split the profits based on the performance and usage of their modules. This could incentivize developers to create high-quality modules with long-term value.
3. **Subscription-Based Models**: Transitioning from one-time purchase options to subscription-based models that generate recurring revenue for developers. This model would benefit both developers and users by ensuring consistent updates and ongoing support for modules.
4. **Long-Term Partnerships**: Establishing partnerships with developers to continually enhance and promote successful modules. Customized revenue structures and collaborative marketing efforts could be introduced as part of these partnerships.

## Initial Phase Profit-Sharing Approach

At the start, the StaFi Modularity Store will implement the following straightforward and flexible models:

1. **Module Pricing**: Developers will have full control over setting the prices for their modules, with a focus on one-time purchase models. StaFi will not take a commission from these sales, giving developers complete freedom in determining their pricing strategies.
2. **Listing Fees**: Developers may be charged a listing fee by StaFi, depending on the module's type and the nature of the collaboration. These fees will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, ensuring fairness and alignment with the value of the module being offered.
3. **Incentives and Rewards**: To encourage the development of high-quality modules, StaFi will provide additional rewards for those achieving high usage or excellent ratings. Developers can also earn extra rewards by participating in platform-sponsored competitions or promotional activities, further boosting their visibility and success within the StaFi ecosystem.

This flexible system will be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure it meets the evolving needs of developers and aligns with the growth of the modularity store.
