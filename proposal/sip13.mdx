## Abstract

This proposal recommends allocating 1 million FIS from the DAO treasury to foster growth and adoption of the LSaaS ecosystem. The funds will be distributed in two rounds. If no projects apply or fail to meet the criteria, the allocated FIS will return to the DAO treasury. Eligible projects will undergo a DAO governance process, and if approved by a community vote, they will receive the grant. Otherwise, the funds will be returned to the treasury.

## Motivation

Since the launch of LSaaS, we've integrated multiple ecosystems over the past six months, including ETH, EVM, Eigenlayer, Karak, Babylon, and more. Recently, we introduced LSaaS Modularity, a significant milestone that enables further expansion. This update allows any third party or developer to submit modules for LSaaS integration, gaining co-marketing opportunities and increased visibility and adoption.

To encourage more developers to build within the LSaaS ecosystem and drive adoption, we propose a 1 million FIS allocation from the DAO treasury to support the LSaaS ecosystem's growth.

## Specification

### **Eligibility** Requirement

The scope of projects eligible for submission is limited to the following:

- **New LST/LRT Integration into LSaaS:** Integrating new Liquid Staking Tokens (LST) or Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRT) into the LSaaS platform.
- **Building New Projects Based on LSaaS:** Constructing new projects utilizing LSaaS and achieving a certain level of growth within the corresponding ecosystem.

Submission requirements include:

- **Grant Proposal Submission:** Submit a grant proposal within the time window for each round of grant applications.
- **Code and Project Demonstration:** If the project already has implemented code or has reached a certain level of development, submit the GitHub link to the code or a project demo.

The proposal should include, but is not limited to, the following content:

- **Project Motivation and Specification:** Clearly outline the motivation behind the project and the technical specifications or features it aims to deliver.
- **Project Milestones:** Define key milestones, including deliverables and timelines, that will track the project's progress.
- **Grant Amount and Allocation:** Specify the total grant amount requested and detail how the funds will be allocated across various project activities.

### Cycle

- Budget: 1 million FIS from Treasury (not new minting)
- Category:
    - New LST/LRT Integration(up to 100K FIS)
        - EVM, CosmWasm : up to 60K FIS
        - LRT: up to 100K FIS
    - New Projects Based on LSaaS(up to 200K FIS)
        - EVM, CosmWasm : up to 120K FIS
        - LRT: up to 200K FIS
- Application Window: tbd, 7 days
- Review Period: tbd, 7 days
- Voting Period: tbd, 7 days


### Community Incentive

Currently, monthly rewards are distributed to community mods for their contributions. However, given the relatively low day-to-day workload, we will shift these incentives toward LSaaS adoption efforts. Mods who successfully pitch or establish connections with new, high-quality Layer 1 projects will receive additional rewards.

Since the amounts involved are modest, these expenses will continue to be covered by the existing budget. Contributions should continue to be submitted monthly on the community forum.
